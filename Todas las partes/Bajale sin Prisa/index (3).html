    <p id="tupapito"><br>This entire campaign begins with a group of students from the multimedia training program in the National Learning Service (Sena) because we have to contribute to our educational area with a training project, with the purpose of contributing
         to a difficulty in commune 4 from Medell√≠n. After several weeks of analysis of different aspects of the sector and its inhabitants, 
         we found a problem factor which affects this entire community (pedestrians, drivers, children,) with the need to call for the safety of our inhabitants,
          we decided create this campaign in order to contribute to this community.. </br></p>
